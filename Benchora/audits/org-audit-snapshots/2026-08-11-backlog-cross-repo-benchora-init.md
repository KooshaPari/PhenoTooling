# Snapshot: Benchora Cross-Repo Gap Audit — 2026-08-11

## Summary

Point-in-time audit of Benchora's structural alignment with the
Phenotype cross-repo expectations catalogued by
`_cockpit/XREPO_BACKLOG.json`. This snapshot closes the
"no audits/ directory" gap (5-repo cluster: Benchora, PhenoPlugins,
Eidolon, RepoLedger, ResearchLedger) and seeds the four canonical
sub-directories described in `audits/README.md`.

## Snapshot details

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| Audit date (UTC) | 2026-08-11 |
| Auditor | `agent-droid-phenotype` (session-20260811) |
| Repo | `KooshaPari/Benchora` (HEAD `c8e4f36`) |
| Backlog ID | `BACKLOG-CROSSREPO-001` |
| Source catalog | `_cockpit/XREPO_BACKLOG.json` `cross_repo_gaps_filtered[1]` |
| Gap closed | "No audit/audits/ directory (no audit-trail artifacts)" |
| Repos in cluster | Benchora, PhenoPlugins, Eidolon, RepoLedger, ResearchLedger |

## What landed

- `audits/README.md` — canonical directory contract (5 sub-dirs,
  append-only, file-naming, cross-ref to registry)
- `audits/org-audit-snapshots/2026-08-11-backlog-cross-repo-benchora-init.md`
  (this file)
- Placeholder sub-directories: `postmortems/`, `ci-exceptions/`,
  `boundary-reconciliation/`, `absorption-justifications/` (each
  seeded with a `.gitkeep` so the structure is reproducible on
  clone).
