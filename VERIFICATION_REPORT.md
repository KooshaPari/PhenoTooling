# Preview verification report

## Repeatable local verification gate (2026-09-08)

Run `npm run verify` for the local release candidate gate. It runs Vercel's
local build first because the Node output contract reads
`.vercel/output/static`; it then runs the unit suite, syntax checks, stages the
publication artifact, and exercises that staged `dist/` artifact with
Playwright through `scripts/preview-server.js` on `127.0.0.1:4197`.

`npm run test:e2e` is available when only the staged browser suite is needed.
`npm run preview` stages the same artifact before serving it for manual local
review. Neither command deploys, attaches a domain, or changes remote state.

Local prerequisites are Node/npm with the checked-in dependencies installed,
the Vercel CLI plus usable local project configuration for `vercel build`, and
Chrome because Playwright is configured with its `chrome` channel. Port 4197
must be available. This documents the verified local environment; it is not a
claim of clean-clone or hosted-preview reproducibility.

Top-level no-JavaScript pages are generated at staging time from the same
shell and route renderers as the enhanced application. The generated scope is
limited to `/`, `/engineering`, `/product`, `/work`, `/resume`, `/contact`,
and `/blog`; project and published blog-post detail routes retain separate
prerender paths.

Project static pages also receive the shared primary shell. Their static view
keeps clean Work, Writing, Resume, and Contact links plus project text and
downloads, while rich controls are removed until JavaScript enhancement.

Published blog-post pages use the same shared shell and their existing post
renderer at staging time. The static scope follows `data/posts.js` and does
not create pages for unknown slugs; it preserves article text, clean primary
navigation, post metadata, and a clean `/blog` return link without JavaScript.

- `node --check scripts/app.js`: PASS
- `node --check data/projects.js`: PASS
- `node --check scripts/components/evidence.js`: PASS
- Static server app/asset HTTP checks: PASS
- Home, Engineering, Product, Work, Resume, Contact routes: PASS
- Work filters and project detail hashes: PASS
- Active tab `aria-selected` synchronization: PASS
- Desktop/mobile screenshots captured under `output/technical-atelier-review/`: PASS
- Vercel static-output contract: PASS (15/15 `npm test`)
- Task 5 visual re-review blockers (WITF responsive crop, opening dead zones, heterogeneous sequence proof, stale status claim): RESOLVED
- aside → div role="note" accessibility fix for nested-complementary-landmark: APPLIED
- Console errors/warnings across home, engineering, product, work, resume, contact (HTTP): 0 / 0
- Horizontal overflow at 1440 / 768 / 375: none
- Production DNS/redirect/legacy retirement mutation: NOT PERFORMED
- Stable in-process Node static-server route sweep (Playwright + Chromium): 10/10 PASS — every route has a visible h1, zero horizontal overflow, zero console errors (routes: home, engineering, product, work, resume, contact, sharecli, gmk-arch, witf, netweave).
- axe-core sweep: 10/10 CLEAN after Work Index card heading h3 -> h2 fix (styles/main.css updated).
- HTTP screenshot pack refreshed post-fix: home-http-{1440,768,375}.png, sequence-http-1440.png under output/technical-atelier-review/.
- Vercel static output re-synced to post-fix source (styles/main.css + scripts/ verified byte-identical).

Remaining human-review items: Lighthouse/performance audit on hosted preview, final case-study copy review, canonical resume links, and deployed-preview metadata/redirect checks. Vercel redeployment requires auth token (sandbox lacks Vercel credential).

## Technical Atelier interaction acceptance

Project Index sequence: open Index, traverse the first three project links by keyboard, close with Escape, verify focus returns to the Index trigger, reopen, and navigate to `#work/sharecli`. Verify at 1440px and 390px with no clipped catalog groups.
